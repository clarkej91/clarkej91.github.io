NBA Random Player Generator 

HOW TO USE:
When NBA logo is clicked, Random NBA player is generated. 
Towards the bottom of the page, There is a carousel of some NBA players.

TECHNOLOGY:
I used an API to search a database and use that information to give the user a random player.

BUGS/PROBLEMS:
My only hang up is sometimes when clicking the random button and then clicking the next or previous button, it still 
displays the players picture. Had to switch ideas a few times because the API I was using had a max call of 100 per page, 
originaly when first use there was no max so I could search the whole database.
